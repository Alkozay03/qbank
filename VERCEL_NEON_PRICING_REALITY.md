# Vercel + Neon Pricing Analysis: Database Connections

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Question**: Do we need to upgrade Vercel to use PgBouncer/database properly?

---

## 🎯 The Short Answer: NO

**You can use Neon's PgBouncer on Vercel's FREE tier.**

PgBouncer is a **database feature** (provided by Neon), not a Vercel feature. Vercel doesn't charge you for database connections.

## 💡 The Real Question

You said: *"20 dollars every month is manageable but an estimate of 30 dollars which may or may not be correct"*

### Where does the $30 come from?

**Current costs**:
- Vercel: $0 (Hobby tier - likely)
- Neon: $0 (Free tier - likely)
- **Prisma Accelerate: $29** ← This is your $30!

**If you drop Accelerate and upgrade Neon**:
- Vercel: $0
- Neon: $19
- Prisma Accelerate: $0
- **Total: $19/month**

**If you upgrade Vercel Pro instead**:
- Vercel: $20
- Neon: $0 (but auto-suspend issues remain)
- Prisma Accelerate: $0
- **Total: $20/month**

---

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

### **Do This (Best ROI)**:

1. **Drop Prisma Accelerate** (save $29)
2. **Upgrade Neon to Launch** ($19)
3. **Keep Vercel on Hobby** (FREE)

**Result**:
- Cost: $19/month (save $10/month = $120/year)
- Performance: Good (no cold starts)
- PgBouncer: Yes (included)
- No caching: Accept it or add Redis later

### **Why This Works**:

**Neon Launch solves your real problems**:
- ✅ No auto-suspend → consistent performance
- ✅ PgBouncer included → handles connections
- ✅ 10 GB storage → room to grow
- ✅ 300 hours compute → enough for 226 students

**Vercel Hobby is sufficient**:

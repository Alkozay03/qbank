# Cascading Filter System Implementation

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Counts API Endpoint**
**File:** `src/app/api/quiz/dynamic-counts/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Calculates real-time question counts for each tag category
- Uses **OR logic within categories** (multiple rotations = more questions)
- Uses **AND logic across categories** (rotation + resource = intersection)
- Progressive filtering based on upstream selections
- Returns counts for: rotations, resources, disciplines, systems

**How it works:**
```
User selects: Unused + Pediatrics
API returns: {
  rotations: { peds: 45, surgery: 60, ... },
  resources: { fa: 15, uworld: 20, ... },  // Based on unused + peds
  disciplines: { cardiology: 8, ... },      // Based on unused + peds
  systems: { cardiovascular: 5, ... }        // Based on unused + peds
}
```

### 2. **Updated Question Selection Logic**
**File:** `src/lib/quiz/selectQuestions.ts`

**Changes:**
- Modified to use OR within same tag category
- Multiple rotations now ADD questions instead of filtering to intersection
- Example: Peds (45) + ObGyn (40) = 85 questions, not 0

---

### 3. **No Questions Found Modal**
**File:** `src/components/NoQuestionsModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Nice modal with opaque black background (60% opacity)
- ✅ Shows selected filters that resulted in 0 questions
- ✅ Warning icon and clear messaging
- ✅ "Adjust Filters" button to close
- ✅ Displays formatted filter names (not raw keys)

---

### 4. **Cascading Filter System Component**
**File:** `src/components/CascadingFilterSystem.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (UWorld-style)
- ✅ Question Mode always visible, counts never change
- ✅ Rotations unlock after mode selection
- ✅ Resources unlock after rotation selection
- ✅ Disciplines unlock after resource selection
- ✅ Systems unlock after discipline selection
- ✅ Counts update automatically when upstream changes
- ✅ Downstream selections reset when upstream changes
- ✅ Multiple selections allowed within each category
- ✅ Grayed out with "—" when locked

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Progressive Unlock Flow:
```
Step 1: Question Mode (Always clickable)
  User selects: Unused (150 questions)
  ↓
Step 2: Rotations (Now clickable, showing counts)
  Peds: 45, Surgery: 60, ObGyn: 45
  User selects: Peds + ObGyn
  ↓
Step 3: Resources (Now clickable, counts based on unused + peds/obgyn)
  FA: 30, UWorld: 40, Amboss: 20
  User selects: FA
  ↓
Step 4: Disciplines (Now clickable, counts based on unused + peds/obgyn + FA)
  Cardiology: 10, Anatomy: 8
  User selects: Cardiology + Anatomy
  ↓
Step 5: Systems (Now clickable, counts based on all above)
  Cardiovascular: 12, Respiratory: 6
  User selects: Cardiovascular
```

### Count Update Rules:
| Category | Counts Based On | Changes When |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Question Mode | Total DB | Never |
| Rotations | Mode | Mode changes |
| Resources | Mode + Rotations | Mode or Rotations change |
| Disciplines | Mode + Rotations + Resources | Any above changes |
| Systems | Mode + Rotations + Resources + Disciplines | Any above changes |

## 📋 What Still Needs To Be Done

### **Next Steps (DON'T COMMIT YET - TESTING REQUIRED):**

1. **Integrate CascadingFilterSystem into create-test pages**
   - Replace old filter UI in `year4/create-test/page.tsx`
   - Replace old filter UI in `year5/create-test/page.tsx`
   - Wire up NoQuestionsModal

2. **Update create-test pages to use new selections**
   - Remove old state management
   - Use selections from CascadingFilterSystem
   - Handle "Create Test" button validation
   - Show NoQuestionsModal when count = 0

3. **Test thoroughly:**
   - ✅ Select Unused → see rotation counts
   - ✅ Select Peds → see resource counts
   - ✅ Select FA → see discipline counts
   - ✅ Select Cardio → see system counts
   - ✅ Change mode from Unused to Incorrect → all counts update
   - ✅ Select multiple rotations → counts don't go to 0
   - ✅ Try to create test with 0 questions → see modal
   - ✅ Verify randomization still works
   - ✅ Check that OR logic works (peds + obgyn = sum)

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
- All filters visible at once
- Counts based on AND logic only
- Selecting multiple rotations showed 0 (confusing)
- No clear hierarchy or guidance

### After:
- Progressive disclosure guides user
- Counts based on OR within category, AND across
- Selecting multiple rotations shows combined count
- Clear numbered steps (1-5)
- Grayed out sections with "Select X First" hints
- Real-time count updates
- Nice modal for edge cases

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] Mode counts never change
- [ ] Rotations unlock after mode selection
- [ ] Resources unlock after rotation selection
- [ ] Counts update when changing upstream selections
- [ ] Multiple selections work (peds + obgyn)
- [ ] Counts don't go to 0 when selecting siblings
- [ ] NoQuestionsModal appears when appropriate
- [ ] Quiz creation still works
- [ ] Randomization still works
- [ ] Both year4 and year5 work identically

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT COMMIT YET

All files created and ready for testing, but:
1. Need to integrate into create-test pages
2. Need thorough local testing
3. Need to verify production data behavior

**Test first, then commit!** 🧪

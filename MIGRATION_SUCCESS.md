## üéØ Next Steps - Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Seed Initial Tags (Optional but Recommended)

Run this in your Neon SQL Editor to add Week and Lecture tags:

```sql
-- Insert Week tags (Week 1 through Week 10)
INSERT INTO "PreClerkshipTag" ("id", "type", "value") VALUES
('pct_week_1', 'WEEK', 'Week 1'),
('pct_week_2', 'WEEK', 'Week 2'),
('pct_week_3', 'WEEK', 'Week 3'),
('pct_week_4', 'WEEK', 'Week 4'),
('pct_week_5', 'WEEK', 'Week 5'),
('pct_week_6', 'WEEK', 'Week 6'),
('pct_week_7', 'WEEK', 'Week 7'),
('pct_week_8', 'WEEK', 'Week 8'),
('pct_week_9', 'WEEK', 'Week 9'),
('pct_week_10', 'WEEK', 'Week 10')
ON CONFLICT ("type", "value") DO NOTHING;

-- Insert Lecture tags (Lecture 1 through Lecture 10)
INSERT INTO "PreClerkshipTag" ("id", "type", "value") VALUES
('pct_lecture_1', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 1'),
('pct_lecture_2', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 2'),
('pct_lecture_3', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 3'),
('pct_lecture_4', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 4'),
('pct_lecture_5', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 5'),
('pct_lecture_6', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 6'),
('pct_lecture_7', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 7'),
('pct_lecture_8', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 8'),
('pct_lecture_9', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 9'),
('pct_lecture_10', 'LECTURE', 'Lecture 10')
ON CONFLICT ("type", "value") DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 2: Test Your Pages

Your new pages are ready to test:

**Student Portals:**
- http://localhost:3000/year1
- http://localhost:3000/year2
- http://localhost:3000/year3

**Admin Pages (for admins):**
- http://localhost:3000/year1/admin/bulk-question-manager
- http://localhost:3000/year2/admin/bulk-question-manager
- http://localhost:3000/year3/admin/bulk-question-manager

## üöÄ What You Can Do Now

### ‚úÖ READY TO USE:
1. **Access Year 1/2/3 portals** - Dashboards work!
2. **View dashboard stats** - Shows 0 questions (none added yet)
3. **See admin placeholders** - Admin pages are accessible

### ‚è≥ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION:
1. **Bulk Question Manager** - Currently placeholder, needs full implementation
2. **API Endpoints** - Need CRUD operations for questions
3. **Quiz Creation** - Need to build quiz builder for pre-clerkship
4. **Tag Management** - Need UI for managing Week/Lecture tags

## üìä System Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Database Schema | ‚úÖ Complete | All tables created |
| Prisma Client | ‚úÖ Generated | Models available in code |
| Portal Pages | ‚úÖ Complete | Year 1/2/3 dashboards working |
| Admin Routes | ‚úÖ Created | Placeholder pages ready |
| Dashboard Stats API | ‚úÖ Working | Shows 0 questions initially |
| Bulk Question Manager | ‚è≥ Placeholder | Needs full implementation |
| Question CRUD APIs | ‚ùå Not Started | Need to build |
| Quiz Builder | ‚ùå Not Started | Need to build |

## üé® Design Consistency Verified

All pages use identical styling to Year 4/5:
- ‚úÖ Same Shell component
- ‚úÖ Same color scheme (primary/primary-light)
- ‚úÖ Same gradients and shadows
- ‚úÖ Same fonts and spacing
- ‚úÖ Same layout structure

## üîß Quick Test

Try this to see if the Prisma client works:

```typescript
// In any API route or server component:
import { prisma } from "@/server/db";

// Count Pre-Clerkship questions (should be 0)
const count = await prisma.preClerkshipQuestion.count();
console.log("Pre-Clerkship Questions:", count);
```

## üéâ Success!

Your Pre-Clerkship system is now fully operational at the database level! The foundation is solid and ready for building the admin interface and question management features.

---

## ‚ú® Changes Made

### 1. **Year Selector in Question Editor** (Both Year 4 & Year 5)

**Location**: Top of the question editor modal (before question text)

**Appearance**:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ QUESTION YEAR                                    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Select which year this question belongs to...   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                                  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  [  Year 4  ]    [  Year 5  ]                   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                                  ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**How It Works**:
- Click **"Year 4"** button ‚Üí Removes all Y5 occurrences, adds Y4 occurrence if needed
- Click **"Year 5"** button ‚Üí Removes all Y4 occurrences, adds Y5 occurrence if needed
- Currently selected year is highlighted in blue
- Unselected year shows as white with blue border

**Benefits**:
- Quick one-click year selection
- Visual feedback showing which year is selected
- Automatically manages the underlying QuestionOccurrence records

---

### 2. **View Questions Page Filtering**

**Year 4 Admin ‚Üí View Questions**:
- ‚úÖ Now only shows questions with `year: "Y4"` in their occurrences
- ‚ùå Year 5 questions will NOT appear

**Year 5 Admin ‚Üí View Questions**:
- ‚úÖ Now only shows questions with `year: "Y5"` in their occurrences
- ‚ùå Year 4 questions will NOT appear

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Year 4
body: JSON.stringify({
  year: 'Y4',  // ‚Üê Added this filter
  rotations: selRotations,
  // ...
})

// Year 5
body: JSON.stringify({
  year: 'Y5',  // ‚Üê Added this filter
  rotations: selRotations,
  // ...
})
```

---

### 3. **API Endpoint Update**

**File**: `/api/admin/questions/search/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Accepts `year` parameter in request body
- Filters questions by QuestionOccurrence.year
- Only returns questions that have at least one occurrence matching the specified year

**Query**:
```typescript
if (yearFilter) {
  whereFilters.push({
    occurrences: {
      some: {
        year: yearFilter,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

## üîß Technical Details

### How the Year Selector Works

**Before** (Manual QuestionOccurrence Management):
```typescript
// Had to manually add occurrences like:
occurrences: [
  { year: 'Y4', rotation: 'im', orderIndex: 0 },
  { year: 'Y5', rotation: 'surgery', orderIndex: 1 }
]
```

**After** (One-Click Year Selection):
```typescript
// Click "Year 4" button:
// - Filters out all Y5 occurrences
// - Ensures at least one Y4 occurrence exists
// - Auto-manages the occurrences array

// Click "Year 5" button:
// - Filters out all Y4 occurrences
// - Ensures at least one Y5 occurrence exists
// - Auto-manages the occurrences array
```

### State Management

The year selector modifies `editedQuestion.occurrences`:
```typescript
setEditedQuestion((prev) => {
  const existing = Array.isArray(prev.occurrences) ? [...prev.occurrences] : [];
  const withoutY5 = existing.filter((occ) => occ.year !== 'Y5');
  const hasY4 = withoutY5.some((occ) => occ.year === 'Y4');
  if (!hasY4) {
    withoutY5.push({ 
      clientKey: makeOccurrenceKey(), 
      year: 'Y4', 
      rotation: '', 
      orderIndex: withoutY5.length 
    });
  }
  // ... normalize and update
});
```

---

## üìä Default Behavior

### Existing Questions
- ‚úÖ If a question already has Y4 occurrences ‚Üí Shows as "Year 4" selected
- ‚úÖ If a question already has Y5 occurrences ‚Üí Shows as "Year 5" selected
- ‚úÖ If a question has BOTH ‚Üí Shows last added year
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If a question has NO occurrences ‚Üí Neither button highlighted (rare case)

### New Questions
- In Year 4 admin: Click "Year 4" button before saving
- In Year 5 admin: Click "Year 5" button before saving

---

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. **One Year at a Time (via Quick Selector)**
The year selector enforces mutual exclusivity:
- Clicking "Year 4" removes ALL Y5 occurrences
- Clicking "Year 5" removes ALL Y4 occurrences
- This prevents confusion and keeps questions clearly separated

### 2. **Advanced: Questions in Both Years**
If you need a question in BOTH years:
- Use the **"Question Appearances"** section lower in the editor
- Manually add multiple occurrences:
  - One with `year: "Y4"`
  - One with `year: "Y5"`
- The year selector will show the last occurrence's year

### 3. **View Questions Filtering**
- Year 4 admin can ONLY see Y4 questions
- Year 5 admin can ONLY see Y5 questions
- This prevents accidental editing of the wrong year's questions

### 4. **Existing Question Pool**
- All current questions default to Year 4 (since they were created before Year 5 existed)
- You can change them to Year 5 by:
  1. Opening the question in Year 5 admin
  2. Clicking "Year 5" button
  3. Saving

5. Fill in question text, options, answer, explanation
6. Save the question
7. ‚úÖ Question now appears in Year 5 create-test

### Scenario 2: Move an Existing Question from Year 4 to Year 5

1. Go to **Year 5 Admin** ‚Üí "View Questions"
2. Search for the question (won't find it because it's Y4)

4. Find and click "Edit" on the question
5. Click **"Year 5"** button at the top
6. Save the question

# Vercel Pro Investigation - Can It Replace Prisma Accelerate?

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Goal:** Determine if Vercel Pro ($20/month) can replace Prisma Accelerate ($29/month)

---

## Current Situation

**Stack:**
- Vercel Hobby Plan: $0/month
- Neon PostgreSQL: $2/month
- Prisma Accelerate: $29/month
- **Total: $31/month**

**Why We Use Prisma Accelerate:**
1. **Connection Pooling** - Prevents "too many connections" errors from serverless cold starts
2. **Query Caching** - Caches repeated queries (75-80% hit rate) for fast response
3. **Prepared Statement Handling** - Avoids PgBouncer transaction mode errors

---

## Questions for Vercel AI/Support

### **Question 1: Connection Pooling**
> Does Vercel Pro provide any native connection pooling for external PostgreSQL databases?

**What we need to know:**
- Can Vercel Pro manage database connections so serverless functions don't create 100+ concurrent connections?
- Is there a built-in proxy/pooler between Vercel functions and external databases?

**Expected answer:** Likely NO - Vercel is a hosting platform, not a database proxy service

---

### **Question 2: Direct PgBouncer Usage**
> Can we connect to Neon's built-in PgBouncer pooler (`xxx-pooler.neon.tech`) from Vercel Hobby plan?

**What we need to know:**
- Is there any Vercel limitation preventing us from using external connection poolers?
- Does this require Vercel Pro or work on Hobby?

**Expected answer:** YES - Should work on Hobby (it's just a different DATABASE_URL endpoint)

**Follow-up:** If YES, then we DON'T need Vercel Pro at all!

---

### **Question 3: Query Caching**
> Does Vercel Pro include Redis, KV, or any caching layer we could use to cache Prisma query results?

**What we need to know:**
- Vercel KV (Redis): Is it included in Pro or an additional cost?
- Edge Config: Can it be used for query caching or is it only for configuration?
- Data Cache API: Does it work with Prisma queries?

**Expected answers:**
- **Vercel KV:** Additional cost (~$20-60/month based on usage) - NOT included in Pro
- **Edge Config:** Only for small config data, NOT for query caching
- **Data Cache:** For fetch() requests, NOT for Prisma database queries

---

### **Question 4: Prepared Statements**
> When using Prisma with external PostgreSQL through PgBouncer (transaction mode), 
> we get "prepared statement already exists" errors. Does Vercel Pro solve this?

**What we need to know:**
- Is there any Vercel infrastructure that handles prepared statements differently on Pro?

**Expected answer:** NO - This is a Prisma + PgBouncer issue, not a Vercel issue

**Solution:** Add `statement_cache_size=0` to connection string (FREE solution)

---

## Hypothesis: Vercel Pro Won't Help

### **What Vercel Pro Actually Provides:**
✅ Edge Config (10 stores, 100MB) - For configuration, NOT database caching  
✅ 1 TB bandwidth - We use ~10GB/month  
✅ 10M edge requests - We use ~200K/month  
✅ Team collaboration - We're a solo developer  
✅ Advanced monitoring - Nice but not essential  
✅ Faster builds - Marginal benefit  

### **What We Actually Need:**
❌ Database connection pooling → Use Neon's `-pooler` endpoint (FREE)  
❌ Query result caching → Accept slower queries OR add Upstash Redis (free tier)  
❌ Prepared statement handling → Add `statement_cache_size=0` parameter (FREE)  

---

## Expected Outcome from Vercel Support

**Most Likely Response:**
> "Vercel Pro doesn't provide database connection pooling or query caching. 
> We recommend using your database provider's connection pooler (Neon's PgBouncer) 
> and implementing your own caching layer if needed. Vercel KV is available as an 
> add-on for Redis caching."

**Translation:**
- Vercel Pro won't replace Prisma Accelerate
- We should use Neon's built-in pooler (works on Hobby plan)
- Caching would cost EXTRA on top of Pro

## Cost Analysis After Vercel Response

### **Scenario A: Keep Current (If Vercel Says No)**
```
Vercel Hobby:       $0/month
Neon:               $2/month  
Prisma Accelerate:  $29/month
TOTAL:              $31/month
```

### **Scenario B: Drop Accelerate (Recommended)**
```
Vercel Hobby:       $0/month
Neon:               $2/month
TOTAL:              $2/month
Savings:            $29/month = $348/year
Trade-off:          500ms slower filter queries (acceptable)
```

### **Scenario C: Upgrade to Pro + Drop Accelerate**
```
Vercel Pro:         $20/month
Neon:               $2/month
TOTAL:              $22/month
Benefit:            ZERO for our use case
Waste:              $20/month on unused features
```

### **Scenario D: Upgrade to Pro + Keep Accelerate**
```
Vercel Pro:         $20/month
Neon:               $2/month
Prisma Accelerate:  $29/month
TOTAL:              $51/month
Benefit:            Team features we don't need
Result:             WORST option
```

## Decision Tree

```
Ask Vercel Support
      |
      ├─> "Pro includes connection pooling/caching"
      |   └─> Upgrade to Pro ($20/month)
      |       Drop Accelerate ($29/month)
      |       TOTAL: $22/month (save $9/month)
      |
      └─> "Pro doesn't help with databases" (EXPECTED)
          └─> Stay on Hobby ($0/month)
              Use Neon pooler (FREE)
              Drop Accelerate ($29/month)
              TOTAL: $2/month (save $29/month) ✅
```

## Next Steps

1. **Submit question to Vercel support** (copy from top of this document)
2. **Wait for response** (usually 24-48 hours)
3. **Based on response:**
   - If they say Pro helps → Consider upgrading
   - If they say Pro doesn't help → Proceed with DROP_ACCELERATE_PLAN.md

---

## Additional Questions to Ask (If Needed)

**Follow-up 1:**
> "If I use Neon's pooler endpoint directly (xxx-pooler.neon.tech) from Vercel Hobby, 
> will I hit any connection limits or need to upgrade?"

**Follow-up 2:**
> "What's the pricing for Vercel KV (Redis)? Could I use it to cache Prisma query 
> results as an alternative to Prisma Accelerate?"

**Follow-up 3:**
> "Does Vercel's Data Cache API work with Prisma ORM queries, or only with fetch() requests?"

---

## Final Recommendation (Before Vercel Response)

**99% Confident:** Vercel Pro won't help with your database connection issues.

**Best Path Forward:**
1. Ask Vercel support to be 100% sure
2. When they confirm Pro doesn't help (expected)
3. Implement DROP_ACCELERATE_PLAN.md
4. Save $348/year

**Alternative (If Impatient):**
- Skip asking Vercel
- Go straight to implementing DROP_ACCELERATE_PLAN.md
- You already have everything you need:
  - Neon's `-pooler` endpoint (FREE connection pooling)
  - Prisma connection string fix (FREE prepared statement solution)
  - Willingness to accept 500ms delay (FREE query caching alternative)

---

## Technical Evidence (For Vercel)

**Current Connection String (via Accelerate):**
```
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=xxx"
```

**Proposed Direct Connection (FREE):**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/qbank?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&statement_cache_size=0&connect_timeout=10"
```

**What This Proves:**
- `-pooler` endpoint = Neon's PgBouncer (connection pooling)
- `statement_cache_size=0` = Fixes prepared statement errors
- No Vercel dependency = Works on any plan (Hobby or Pro)

---

**Status:** Waiting for Vercel support response
**Expected Response Time:** 24-48 hours
**Expected Answer:** "Pro doesn't help with database connections"
**Expected Next Action:** Proceed with DROP_ACCELERATE_PLAN.md

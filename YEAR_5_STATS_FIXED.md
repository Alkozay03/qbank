# Year 5 Stats Isolation - Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The Year 5 dashboard, previous-tests, and performance pages were showing Year 4 data because they weren't filtering by year. This has been **completely fixed**.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Year 5 Dashboard Stats API** (`/api/year5/dashboard-stats/route.ts`)
**Before**: Counted ALL user quizzes and questions
**After**: 
- First gets all Question IDs that have `QuestionOccurrence.year = "Y5"`
- Only counts responses/quizzes that contain Year 5 questions
- Total questions = only Year 5 questions
- Stats = only from Year 5 quizzes

### 2. **Year 5 Previous Tests** (`/year5/previous-tests/page.tsx`)
**Before**: Showed ALL user quizzes (Year 4 and Year 5 mixed)
**After**:
- Gets Year 5 question IDs
- Only shows quizzes that contain at least one Year 5 question
- Year 4 quizzes won't appear in Year 5 list

### 3. **Year 5 Performance** (`/year5/performance/page.tsx`)
**Before**: Showed stats from ALL questions user answered
**After**:
- Filters responses to only Year 5 questions
- Total questions count = Year 5 questions only
- All stats (correct/incorrect/time) = Year 5 only

## 📊 Expected Behavior NOW

### When You First Open Year 5:
- **Dashboard**: Should show **0% score, 0% usage, 0 tests completed** ✅
- **Previous Tests**: Should show **"No tests yet"** ✅
- **Performance**: Should show **0 correct, 0 incorrect, 0 questions attempted** ✅

### After Creating Your First Year 5 Quiz:
- Year 5 stats update independently
- Year 4 stats remain unchanged
- **Complete isolation** between years

### Year 4 Should Still Work:
- Year 4 dashboard shows only Year 4 stats
- Year 4 previous tests shows only Year 4 quizzes
- Year 4 performance shows only Year 4 stats

---

## 🎯 How Stats Are Now Filtered

Both Year 4 and Year 5 use the same logic pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Get question IDs for specific year
const yearXQuestions = await prisma.question.findMany({
  where: {
    occurrences: {
      some: { year: "Y5" }  // or "Y4" for Year 4
    }
  },
  select: { id: true }
});

// 2. Filter quizzes/responses by those question IDs
prisma.quiz.findMany({
  where: {
    userId,
    items: {
      some: {
        questionId: { in: yearXQuestionIds }  // ← Only quizzes with Year X questions
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Next

### 1. **Add Year 5 Questions** (Required)
Since Year 5 has NO questions yet, you need to add them:

**Option A: Via Admin Interface**
- Go to Year 5 admin panel
- Add questions with Year 5 rotations
- Make sure to add `QuestionOccurrence` entries with `year: "Y5"`

**Option B: Via SQL (if migrating)**
```sql
-- Example: Add a Year 5 question occurrence
INSERT INTO "QuestionOccurrence" (id, questionId, year, rotation, orderIndex, createdAt, updatedAt)
VALUES 
  (gen_random_uuid()::text, 'your_question_id', 'Y5', 'im', 0, NOW(), NOW());
```

### 2. **Verify Stats Isolation**
1. ✅ Open Year 5 - should show zeros
2. ✅ Add some Year 5 questions
3. ✅ Create a Year 5 quiz and complete it
4. ✅ Check Year 5 stats update
5. ✅ Check Year 4 stats remain unchanged

### 3. **Modify Year 5 Rotations** (As You Mentioned)
The rotation system is the same, but Year 5 can have different rotations:
- Edit `src/app/year5/create-test/page.tsx`
- Update the `rotations` array to match Year 5 requirements:
```typescript
const rotations: Option[] = [
  { key: "rotation_a", label: "Year 5 Rotation A" },
  { key: "rotation_b", label: "Year 5 Rotation B" },
  // ... etc
];
```

## 🎉 Summary

**Year 5 is now completely isolated from Year 4!**

- ✅ Questions filtered by year
- ✅ Stats filtered by year  
- ✅ Quizzes filtered by year
- ✅ Performance metrics filtered by year
- ✅ Previous tests filtered by year

Year 5 will show zeros until you:
1. Add Year 5 questions (with `year: "Y5"` in QuestionOccurrence)
2. Create and complete quizzes

Everything is ready to go! 🚀
